To run this application on your system, first go to the directory of the 'App' folder and
run
>>sudo python routes.py		//this will start the server for the web application on localhost port 5000
				//that is flask's default server

open up a web browser and type localhost. This should start the website.

I have included a number of extra files which I am working on at the moment. The application as of now, uploades images to 
a local directory and saves the path to the images in a database. It displays the 10 most recent uploaded pictures however,
I am still working on making the next and back button to function. This application only allows .png, .jpg, .jpeg and .gif 
files to be uploaded. I have to work on the user functionality of the application as well.
